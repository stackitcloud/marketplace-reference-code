# STACKIT Marketplace Reference Code

This repository contains reference implementations for **vendors** looking to integrate with the **STACKIT Marketplace**, demonstrating the subscription approval flow and token validation process.

## What is the STACKIT Marketplace?

The [STACKIT Marketplace](https://docs.stackit.cloud/Marketplace) is a digital platform connecting STACKIT customers with third-party digital products, serving as the technological foundation for rapidly expanding the STACKIT portfolio and building industry-specific cloud offerings. It provides access to a diverse range of products, from IaaS and SaaS to licenses, professional services, and datasets.

## Supported Languages

The integration examples are available in multiple languages:

- [Go](/go) - Go implementation
- [Python](/python) - Python implementation

Each language implementation demonstrates the same core functionality while following language-specific best practices.

## Getting Started

1. Choose your preferred language implementation from the folders above
2. Follow the language-specific README for setup instructions
3. Review the implementation details in the code
4. Adapt the examples to your specific use case

### Integration Flow

1. **Marketplace token validation**: Validates the marketplace token by:
   1. Fetching the public key from STACKIT
   2. Validating the token format
   3. Verifying the token signature
2. **Customer Resolution**: Uses the validated token to resolve customer information
3. **Subscription Approval**: Approves the marketplace subscription

### Key concepts

- **Redirect Token**: The Redirect Token, or simply token, is the JWT Token sent to the vendors when the STACKIT Marketplace redirects consumers to the vendor's `Sign Up/Login` page, which happens in the process of creating a subscription (see [SaaS Frontend Integration](https://docs.stackit.cloud/stackit/en/saas-frontend-integration-290718118.html) for more details).
